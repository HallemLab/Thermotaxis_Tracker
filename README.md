# Thermotaxis_Tracker
Thermotaxis Single Worm Tracking Codebase

## Description
Custom MATLAB scripts that translate pixel-based x/y coordinates into cm- and temperature-based coordinates. Generates plots of worm tracks. These scripts also calculate various quantifications, including: overall mean speed, mean speed within specified temperature bins, distance ratio (maximum distance traveled divided by the maximum displacement), and final temperature difference (final temperature minus starting temperature).

## Versions
A note regarding version numbers within this repository. Version control (and advancing version numbers) is primarly handled within an internal (private) Hallem Lab Codebase. Therefore, numerical versions within this repository are not necessarily inclusive.

**Version 1** was used to generate plots and quantifications included in [Bryant *et al* 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30017486)
